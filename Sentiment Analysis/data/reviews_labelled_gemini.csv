Penthouse was very clean and in pristine condition.<br/>Niklas and Victoria left us a personalised note with everything we needed to know about the penthouse and even left us a few beers to welcome us. A one page note is much better than a large manual you find in some apartments!<br/>The street of the penthouse had a lot of cool bars and restaurants, including a very highly recommended restaurant which we ate at, and it did not disappoint! If you're looking for a cool apt in a central location with a chilled and relaxed vibe - this is your place!",1

Only 10 minutes walk from the metro and 2 stops from Old Town. Although the area has many restaurants and bars, the apartment is quiet and has a lot of light. Big bedroom with comfortable bed, lovely kitchen with everything you need and a good size bathroom. Easy to get in and out, but Mikael was also great communicator. Great place when you visit Stockholm!",1

23279126,510694936308802003,2021-12-05,122846533,Gabriella,Such an ideal Airbnb<br/>Went as a group of four friends. Was very clean and big. Modern appliances and comfy sofa. Big dinning room & bathroom was great. <br/>Would deffo recommend anyone going to Stockholm if you’re three or four people this is perfect.<br/>Location was perfect for a two/three night stay. You’re in the historic centre so a good mix of cafes/pubs/restaurants/Christmas Market.<br/>If you want a busier atmosphere or clubs would still suggest Gamla Sta as it’s very well connected with metro/bus.,1

We were comfortable, but the amenities are fairly basic and while the apartment was tidy, it could use a deep clean and small touches, like shampoo in the bathroom and salt in the kitchen which is helpful to travelers.  Otherwise, the central location can’t be beat.",1

10222510,86696754,2016-07-17,29715394,Nora,"This apartment is lovely and has the absolute perfect location for exploring Stockholm. You're right in the heart of the old town island Gamla Stan and about 200 meters from the royal castle. Katia was a very responsive host and very helpful. I would maybe not recommend this apartment to anyone that would want to lounge around the apartment as it is small, especially for our group of 3 people. However, if that is not that case, I can not recommend this apartment enough! ",1
36340282,490293961,2019-07-18,185982462,Nikhil,"This is a charming apartment in what must be the perfect location to base your Stockholm vacation. I loved my time here and would happily stay again.<br/>The space is spotless and very nicely furnished, and the neighborhood offers beautiful walks and countless cafes and restaurants just outside.<br/>There are one or two very minor quirks to make note of, however. The apartment has a tiny water heater and a massive (very nice) shower head so you must bathe quickly before the hot water runs out. There is a square outside with foot traffic late into the night. Be aware that it can be just a bit noisy. When we arrived there was no toilet paper in the bathroom and we could not access the Wi-Fi until contacting the host. <br/>None of these issues detracted from our pleasure at staying in this delightful property, but I felt they were worth mentioning.",1

First of all, she’s very caring and made sure I had an overall pleasant stay through checking in with me and recommending me lots of stuff to do. The place itself is located quite nicely, close to a tram station and 10mins by foot to the next bus and metro station. You’re in the heart of Stockholm in no time.

The description says that there is no own entrance, but this is not the case; we had the whole appartment to ourselves. There is a shared outside door though, for all the inhabitants of the building. We discovered the music system on the first day, which was very nice! Showering was a bit of a challenge, since the showerhead sprays the water everywhere except on your head ;) but the towels compensated this by being very nice and big. Marcella was very helpful. Thanks to you and your sweet son for welcoming us!",1

We spent 10 days in this beautiful, spacious house with our large family (2 parents and 4 kids) for a super vacation in Stockholm. Every of our children had a large bedroom (two even an entire floor) for their own, so much space! Moreover, the house is tastefully decorated with original art pieces and lots of book shelves, creating a very cosy Scandinavian ""hygge"" atmosphere.<br/>Also wonderful was the fact that we were able to use the bikes of the house, being an ideal transportation mode to reach the city centre (35 minutes biking), the tourist attractions on Djurgården, Drottningholm castle, etc.<br/>The house is located in a very quiet neighborhood, with a small supermarket close by, but also children's play gardens, a beach with kayak rental, nature parks, etc.<br/>Very much recommended!",1

It was thoughtfully appointed and furnished in a clean, modern style that had all we needed for our stay. <br/>It is a short walk to either the subway or several bus lines that greatly eased navigating the city. <br/>The apartment faces a quiet park and gets plenty of morning sunshine, which was nice to wake up to.  <br/>It is surrounded by numerous options for dining, drinking, and finding vintage clothing. The first night we found a restaurant  a block away that so impressed us that we returned a few nights later for an encore.  <br/>There was also a large selection of fine foods that could be purchased at a small grocery store only a block away. For more basic items there is COOP store another two blocks further. <br/>Overall, we had a fantastic stay. ",1

The apartment is also just across the road from the metro station, so it only takes around 12 mins from leaving the flat to arriving in the centre of Stockholm.  We also walked into Gamla Stan as it is a lovely walk along the waterfront.  I worried that it would be very hot as we visited in July and it is a top floor flat.

It was a clean apartment, one room with no window, but quite decent. The same evening, we found a guy lying on the floor in front of our apartment. He looked homeless; I called the guest relations. The security came in an hour, but he was gone. We felt insecure. There were also cockroaches (3 big and several mini ones) in the kitchen. We were offered to move to another apartment with one bedroom, which we rejected. The building needs a deep investigation both for pests and security",0

The apartment was overall very clean and just as described. It did have some small issues though; the biggest is probably the absence of blackout curtains - instead you only have blinds which don't block out much daylight and one of the blinds was broken. Really minor, but there were some stains on the sofa and underneath the table. Also, be warned that the ventilation system outside can be quite loud if you have a window open. In the summer this can be slightly annoying as there is no AC (as stated in the description) and the apartment can get quite hot if you don't open a window. Overall, excellent value for money and would stay there again.",1

It's a place with multiple units mainly for students so you might see people people moving around but we never felt uncomfortable. It's true that you can hear some street noice and neighbors but it wasn't a big problem for us. We never had and issue with hot water and everything worked.

Very close to the metro and only one stop to Central Station. Everything is walking distance.  <br/>The apartment itself is tastefully decorated and inviting to come back to after a long day of sightseeing.  The bed was comfortable and there was everything we needed.  The hosts were super responsive to my one small request.   This is a great apartment for either a longer or shorter stay. <br/>Tip- If staying in the summer remember to pack an eye mask as the sun peeks around the edges of the closed blinds in the master bedroom. A small price to pay for having 20 hours of daylight!!<br/>Extra points for having a full size washing machine and dryer and for little touches like current print sightseeing books.,1

It is also very warm (as normal northern house should be) and therefore so comfortable for us. Those who prefer more chilling atmosphere can, of course,  switch radiators off. Our host provided us with exhaustive instructions with regard to house rules and other necessary information.<br/>Just 3 metro stops to Slussen - the very center of Sodermalm.

This was our first visit to Sweden and we felt that we had hit the jackpot with Karl’s home. It was warm, has all the amenities you could wish for and it was like being home from home. <br/>We stayed for a week but could have stayed for three more - we didn’t want to leave! The walk from the local underground station to the house is a very comfortable 10 minute amble, which we happily did daily with a usually reluctant 4 year old! There is a play park and woodlands on route which helped! Local supermarkets providing everything you need, and a short train ride to the centre made for a very easy visit.<br/>Thisbe, their beauty of a cat, will make you feel even more welcome (if that’s even possible!).

Close enough to public transportation. Very comfortable beds. The bathroom was small but functional; I wish water from shower would not run all over bathroom floor. The windows are very old, and I was little bit scared to open them up because once unlocked the top leans back and window is only secured by chain. However, since the air felt stuffy in the appartment, I got the courage to open them. On Fri and Sat mornings we were woken up around 6am by trash pick up or perhaps delivery for the bar under the apartment, but since we were so tired we went back to bed, it didnt bother us. <br/>Overall, I would stay here again!",1
31347264,453937017,2019-05-17,42550610,Steven,"This isn't the typical airbnb. This is not someone's appartment that they've put personal care and attention into to make your stay special. This is a hotel room. But this hotel doesn't have the common ammeneties of a typical hotel: no common sitting area with big windows (which is much needed, I'll get to that in a moment) and staff is only available for the middle 4 hours of the day whenb you're likely out and about.<br/>The room was very clean and of nice quality, but there are NO windows. It's in a great location that is within walking distance of several stores, restaurants, bus stops and the excellent Stockholm subway system.<br/>It was a good price for the location and cleanliness. If you're expecting your airbnb to be a special part of your vacation experience, this one isn't for you. If you're looking for a secure, clean, comfortable place to sleep at night then this will do the trick--just set an alarm to get the day started because you'll never know when it's daylight.",0

It was our most unpleasant  accomodation on our trip with the description of the place not what we got. It’s 52 stairs, with no outdoor area, it’s only one bedrooms (second bed is in the dining room) no stainless steel oven, toaster and kettle old and pealing, no water, harbour, city or lake view as the description says and no blind on the dining room window with 21 hours of day light. Location was great but disappointing when I asked Airbnb to make the host take down the incorrect information so that people are getting what they pay for and their response was “write a review if you’re unhappy, we can’t make hosts rewrite their listings”.

There are two supermarkets (one with a post office), a convenience store, a park, and lots of local amenities just a short walk away.<br/>The flat: The place is bright and well-cleaned. A roomba cleans the floor every day, and there’s a squeegee wiper to keep the shower floor dry. The kitchen is well-stocked with equipment, and the living room is nice and cosy. The only downside is that there’s no washing machine so we had to go to a local laundry place (which Raffaela kindly recommended). Also, since the building is old and the flats don’t have carpets, you can sometimes hear the neighbour upstairs. Nothing too bad though.<br/>The host: Rafaella gives clear instructions on how to find the place, how to check in, and what to do with wastes & recycling. She also responds very quickly to our questions and is extremely helpful.<br/>All in all, it was a pleasant stay and we really recommend it.",1

Near the hotel there is plenty of shops, some nice restaurants perfect for a lunch but also wonderful lane by the water ideal for jogging. The hotel is under ground which means there are no windows or there are small windows, but c'mon Stockholm is not a city that can be watched through the window, it's too beautiful for it. I recommend this hotel as a perfect place to stay in Stockholm and if I ever return there I will for sure stay at Niro.

Six bedrooms offered ample and comfortable sleeping arrangements. The only drawback is that much of the host’s clothing fills the closets and drawers leaving little space to unpack. The kitchen is spacious and well equipped. And we cooked a lot! The dining area fits many people and the outdoor space is nice when the weather permits.  The location is close to the Stureby metro stop which made excursions into the city very convenient. There are also supermarkets nearby and beautiful walking trails and paths.

On the day of our departure (after 4 nights) we finally got a reply with an excuse about why it had been impossible to get back to us (phone dropped in a lake). Our friendly answer to this reply was never answered back on.<br/>This aside, the house itself was to our satisfaction. It is located in a quiet neighbourhood surrounded by nature. In close proximity there is a bus stop which brings you in combination with the metro to the heart of Stockholm in between 30 and 50 minutes, depending on where you want to go. <br/>The house is also very unique and with the two terraces very cosy.<br/>Light sleepers need to keep in mind that the upstairs bedrooms have got no curtains or shutters.",0

Also, lack of windows did not bother me at all. <br/>However, there were some minor issues. For one, there is a spiral metal stair case right above the unit which rattles when people walk up and down late into night. It rattles no matter how queitly they try to walk and some don't even try.

It is situated in the center, so it is very handy to move around plus it’s beautiful every morning and evening when you leave and return home. Many things to see and to do, specially walking around and enjoying the beauty of Stockholm. On the negative side it is a bit noisy over the weekends as there is a pub under it on the street level.

Mia is a very helpful and knowledgeable host and was full of tips and good advice. The apartment was clean and nicely decorated in whites and blues.

The flat was true ro description and very well appointed with nice furniture and comfortable bedding.

Location is good with a lovely riverside walk which goes on for miles with bars and restaurants along the way on both sides of the canal.

33546399,657730066,2020-08-29,43366764,Vénie,"The apartment is very stylish, with a beautiful sight on roofs across the street. If you're not inconvenienced by its drawbacks, it will be a lovely place to be. A burger restaurant is at groundfloor. Smells of coking grease and bins permeate the hall and the stairs, it's gagging and horrid while you climb the three very high stairs. Those strenuous stairs are equivalent to 4/5 modern stairs. The floor of the flat is markedly sloped and could be tricky for some people. Blowing a fuse happens quite often and it gets tedious to go on the threshold, in the putrid smell, to reconnect the circuit. The manager of this listing, Fredrik, announced all these problems only 24h before check-in. We had no choice. We recommend that you demand all check-in information beforehand. We received very few personalized messages, the rest seemed to be sent automatically and didn't answer our queries. Fredrik demanded our personal email address ""to send the check-in information"" but finally sent it via Airbnb. In return, he didn't provide his email address and his last name was hidden on his Airbnb profile. The flat is more arranged to ease the work of the help than for the comfort of the guests, it's weird. Apart of the burger restaurant problem, which is a total nuisance, candor and simplicity about the peculiarities of this flat would do wonders to soften the difficulties. In fact, we would return there if it was managed in a different style.",0

He picked me up from the station, showed me how to best get around and cooked me food several times. As an introverted female solo traveler who is quite new to airbnb, I felt it was a bit much at times, but I think it was all good intentions. The room was a little bit cold even with the heat on, but there are enough blankets to keep you warm. The wifi is good, which was the most important to me, and you have everything you need (space in the fridge and freezer, a microwave, toaster, cooking stuff, etc.).",1

It was like staying in a family home, decorated in an interesting and creative way yet spotless and clean. The location was a short walk to the metro which is easy and nice to use. There were shops, restaurants and groceries nearby. The sofa in the living room was the most comfortable I’ve ever sat on! The light in the house, both from windows and cute lamps made it feel warm and bright. There is even a small patio off the kid’s room. Everything we needed was available and Lina was quick to respond, helpful and so kind. Would highly recommend and would stay here again. And Stockholm is amazing, so much to see and do.

It should be noted that there is a very curious and sneaky cat that is able to enter the room on its own, and actually woke us up in the morning when it jumped up on our window sill and knocked over a pot of flowers and dirt on our floor :( Of course, this isn’t at the fault of the hosts. The door was unable to lock, which contributed to the reason why the cat could access our room. We did have access to the kitchen if needed, and a fridge space as well.

The place is pretty quiet (which made me spend too much time napping) even though it’s very close to the main tourist attractions (about 7 mins to the Old Town by subway, but I usually just walked because the wall passes a very nice neighborhood from where you could get an amazing view of the entire city.)

Our hosts and stay arrangement were a BIG reason why we had such an amazing trip to Stockholm. Let’s start with the apartment in itself: super spacious, separate living room than the already huge bedroom, 1.5 bath plus the sauna!!! Huge TV is included, that we could hook to our Netflix for Netflix and chill time, which was much needed after a long day walking and exploring the beautiful city.  Our hosts were the KINDEST people! Very accommodating and hospitable. They did everything to make our stay comfortable and made sure we had everything we needed. Short walk to the train that is literally 3 stops away from Central station, but on the way to the station, you’ll find everything you need, cute little restaurants/pubs/bakeries, market where we picked up all kinds of goodies for cheap! :) oh and the beds were very comfortable which made for very restful nights of sleep. We literally were so sad to leave to go home, because we felt like this little apartment was our home away from home. Needless to say, we will be back because we absolutely loved this place and our hosts, and also because we have much more to explore in beautiful Stockholm. We couldn’t recommend this place enough, if you’re trying to decide, just pick this place and go! Thank you for everything Lotta and Anders! :)",1

In addition, the Slussen metro station is nearby, allowing you to conveniently and relatively quickly reach even distant places such as Drottningholm Palace.<br/>There are many cafes, bars and restaurants near the apartment, and there is a Lidl supermarket nearby (there are others ones as well, but they are bit more expensive).<br/>Communication with Daniel is very pleasant. The apartment fully corresponds to the description and the price/quality ratio is optimal.<br/>I would be happy to stay with Daniel again on my next visit to Stockholm. I recommend!",1

She was always quick to reply, and very helpful on explaining instructions once we arrived in Stockholm. Sadly, we never met Charlotte, as she was also away at the time - but the keys were left at a near by shop and collecting them was no problem at all!<br/>The flat itself is what we expected and more, as described small and cosy, the terrace was lovely, and the flat itself was well cleaned and presented!  <br/>The area itself and lovely, airport bus around the corner, metro station 2 minute walk (if that), supermarket the same walk, and bars and restaurants around! Really close to the water too where the market is on at weekends. <br/>we hope to return to Stockholm in the near future, and we would defonatly check availability of charlottes flat, highly recommended!!

Bedroom, living room and kitchen, all good. <br/>The neighbourhood was very quite. Not many things to do around but you are 8 mins walking to the green line metro station and from there 20 mins to go the very center of Stockholm. You have 1 supermarket next to the metro station and bigger ones 10 mins walking distance (from the apartment).<br/>The only negative point I can mention is the bathroom. The apartment is on the first floor and there was almost a constant smell from the sewers. It seems to be a building issue so there was not much that Andreas could do about it. Staying for short periods it's not something i'd worry about, but after 2 months was a ""pain point"" for us. <br/>All in all, it was a good choice for us. It would have been perfect if there was not the issue with the bathroom.",1

My room was very cozy and spacious, and I had access to a fully equipped kitchen, shower, and toilet. The neighborhood is a villa area, and it was quiet and lovely. A couple of restaurants and a small grocery store were easily reachable from the accommodation on foot - around a 5-min walk. Bus stop to the nearest tbana stations (that will take you to central Stockholm) was also just a 5-min walk away.<br/>Weihong is a friendly, kind, and helpful host. I also adored her cat!

Checking in was absolutely effortless and everything was ready for us. Daniel describes everything so well that we had no problem whatsoever. He even has some chilled drinks in a fridge (for a little fee). But since we didn’t know that we has brought something for ourselves. If you want to spare that trouble, get it there.<br/>The apartment has a nice balcony, as you can see, and, even though the windows seem pretty thin, when they were closed we didn’t hear that much from the nightlife.<br/>All in all: If you wish to stay a night in the most beautiful city in the world, just stay here.

But this host's cancellation policy was strict and I would get no refund . So as I had only one night to spend before my flight home I decided to go with it. The thing is the neighbours severely object  to airbnb and so the guests are put under severe constraints. Even turning the key in the lock would disturb them. Talking is a no no. The neighbours themselves make a lot of noise as is normal anywhere. but they are legit , I guess !<br/>I am a superhost myself and so I really hate to have to state negative  things The host herself is quite sweet. But it would help if she kept a hot jug and some tea coffee sugar. There is nothing. Only some teas left behind by other guests.No sugar in the house !  But nice of her to leave a bowl of cherries for me.The amenities are minimal and completely outdated. There is a plastic pipe going from under the potty to the water inlet. What made me really uncomfortable is that despite all this the host makes you sign a document which states that you will pay an amount outside of the airbnb resolution centre if amenities are damaged !  I seemed reluctant to sign because the amenities were minimal and could have done with refurbishing  .She said signing was not mandatory but   argued and  I knew beyond a point she would not relent till the night was up.So I signed .Location is great though so if you are ok with other constraints .",0

I left after my first night because the place is unsafe. <br/>The apartment pictures have been photoshopped with light and clouds and even if the entrance is on the ground floor, you have to open metallic curtains and struggle your way down to the basement with obviously no light.<br/>In case of problem you can't exit the apartment and the emergency exit is locked. The place itself looked dirty, there was hair in the clean bedsheets, and water inside the kitchen cabinet plates and bowls. Can't tell if it's from cleaning of humidity. <br/>Prior to my arrival, I wrote to the host several times to tell them that airbnb was automatically translating the messages and the instructions to get in were not clear. They copy pasted me 3 times the same message - unclear then. <br/>After 45 minutes inside the courtyard where I got the keys, (host was obviously not answering even if I mentioned it wasnt clear) that neighbors came to help and took me to the basement.",0

The apartment has all the utensils and crockery to prepare a simple meal in the microwave. The room is small but has enough space for what you need with many electrical sockets. Very comfortable bed.<br/>Li was a great host, a pleasant conversationalist if you want, but respects your privacy if you want to be alone.<br/>I really enjoyed being in Li's flat and meeting her.

I was drawn in by the fairly reasonable price given the location, but arrived to find the front door jammed (which was a consistent issue through the stay). There was some stain/liquid residue on the bedside table which was a bit unsettling, and exposed wires inside the front door handle. The bathroom door handle was broken on arrival and ended up locking me in on one occasion (I would have been completely stuck if I didn't have another guest on the outside to assist me getting out). The paint in the unit appears to be the classic ""landlord-painted-everything-in-one-stroke"" style, which added to the careless feeling of the unit.

Just disappointed that the shower head was broken and held up by a hairclip. If it was 1 night then would have put up with it but just made showering annoying for a week there. The photos made the apartment look larger and cleaner than it was and we were not aware of the 'folding' shower - foreign in our country. They were contactable and helpful.  Also disappointed that small things like no tea towels and there were limited paper towels. Not sufficient hand soap allocated and we ended up buying toilet paper. Not sure on what others expect when for staying this long in a place but those little things help out or at least clear expectations should be communicated.,0

Essentially me and my girlfriend were locked out of the apartment at 2am because we were not notified by the host that the code entry is not active past 9pm.  We were eventually able to reach the host after multiple calls, but still were very upset we had to be locked out for almost a half hour in the middle of the night.  After this experience, we will surely think twice about using Air B&B again as the benefit of potential cost savings and comfort versus a hotel are outweighed by the situation we experienced in this stay.

It is better than the photos and what we really loved about it was how personal it is - family photos and decorations really make you feel like you are in a home, not just a generic investment property.  The space is really great for a family or friends - comfortable and cozy with everything you need.  The kitchen is very well equipped for meals at the apartment.  The location is fantastic!!!!!  So many great restaurants and shops within easy walking distance - try Pascal bakery and Symbios restaurant for dinner - within a few blocks and fantastic!  We like to walk everywhere and were able to walk to all of the major sites from Lina's apartment but if you are not up for walking too far, the metro station is very close and in just a few stops, you can get anywhere you want.

44693990,676610173128856256,2022-07-22,168519620,Richard,"This is an excellent place to stay in Stockholm, perfectly positioned for enjoying the delights of SoFo (South of Folkungagaten) on Sodermalm - a buzzy neighbourhood full of quirky independent shops, cafes and restaurants. Also convenient for getting to other parts of the city as there is a metro station 5 minutes' walk away.<br/>The apartment is spacious, stylish, well-appointed and quiet. We found the double bed most comfortable, despite previous reviews suggesting it to be on the soft side, and the dark curtains are a major advantage during the summer months. The compact kitchen is fine but quite basically equipped - we rustled up a tasty pasta one evening, but best not plan on cooking anything much more elaborate than that!<br/>Entry to the apartment block and the flat is by means of a mobile phone app, which worked fine until our final day. We went out for breakfast, only to discover on our return that our access had been cancelled early so we couldn't get in to collect our bags etc. It was a stressful situation, but we managed to contact Elias who arranged fresh access and we made it to the airport in time. Hopefully the same problem won't arise again, but just in case it might be worth double-checking on the app when access is due to expire. <br/>Overall, I would warmly recommend this accommodation for your visit to Stockholm.",1

She lives up to all of her unique and authentic superhost standards :) You will have your own toilet, shower, kitchenette, washing/dryer (or perhaps shared with another Airbnb’r), your own couch & TV! We would stay here 10x over again. The location is also actually quite convenient via train!",1

It was incredibly reassuring that they always responded to our messages promptly. Their house is impeccably clean and tidy, and the linens were fresh and spotless.<br/>The location is also very convenient—just a pleasant 3-minute walk to the nearest bus stop. The Route 1 bus runs every 10 minutes most of the time and takes you directly to the city center. It stops right in front of the city bus terminal, which is especially convenient for travelers with large luggage.<br/>Overall, we had a fantastic stay and would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area!",1

A five-star hotel wouldn't come close to the charm and hyggeligness of Johanna's (+ family's) house.  The four of us were at a conference at the conference hall about 15 minutes away.  The city centre was a further 10 min. by the commuter rail.   Hence, a great location, not to mention the forested park nearby which was great for jogging.  <br/>What I loved most about the house was the big kitchen and flourishing yard.  The four of us laughed our nights away enjoying hardy home cooked meals under the golden effulgent summer Swedish summer nights.  We loved it.",1

We were disappointed, however, to find that much of the cutlery, the pots and some of the dishes were dirty, even though they were put away in the cupboards. The fridge needed defrosting, one of the lounge room cushions had some dried muck on it, a chair was broken, and the bed and under-sized pillows smelt so strongly of human sweat that my wife felt insulted. The towels were incredibly thin, and the bedding was so old and worn - they should have been replaced long ago. Stefan promptly fixed some of these things when we first raised them, however it needs to be said that this is a lovely apartment that has been spoiled by neglect. A little TLC would make such a difference.",0
