# üè† Airbnb Data Science: Sentiment Analysis & Price Prediction

This project addresses two main challenges using Airbnb data:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying Airbnb reviews as **positive** or **negative** to help hosts, guests, and platforms gain insights into user experiences.
2. **Price Prediction**: Predicting the nightly price of Airbnb listings based on features such as location, amenities, and review sentiment.

## üìä Project Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:

### 1. Sentiment Analysis

We leverage **transfer learning** by pretraining models on publicly available datasets:

- **IMDB Movie Reviews** ‚Äì clear polarity-labeled text data

This approach enables better generalization and more effective sentiment classification on Airbnb reviews.

### 2. Price Prediction

We use machine learning regression models to predict Airbnb listing prices. Features include:

- Listing characteristics (location, number of rooms, amenities, etc.)
- Aggregated sentiment scores from guest reviews

This enables more accurate and data-driven pricing strategies for hosts and platforms.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming text and tabular data.
- **Model Training**:
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Models like SGDClassifier, Logistic Regression, etc., trained on IMDB and fine-tuned on Airbnb.
  - **Price Prediction**: Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) trained on Airbnb listing data.
- **Evaluation**: Using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score (for sentiment) and RMSE, MAE (for price prediction).
