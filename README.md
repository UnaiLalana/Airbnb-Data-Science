# üè† Sentiment Analysis on Airbnb Reviews

This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on Airbnb reviews using models trained on publicly available datasets from **Amazon** and **IMDB**. The goal is to classify each review as **positive** or **negative**, helping hosts, guests, and platforms gain insights into user experiences.

## üìä Project Overview
Although our main interest lies in Airbnb data, we leverage **transfer learning** by pretraining models on:

- **Amazon Product Reviews** ‚Äì diverse user reviews labeled by sentiment
- **IMDB Movie Reviews** ‚Äì clear polarity-labeled text data

This approach allows better generalization and effective application of sentiment classification to Airbnb reviews, even with limited labeled Airbnb data.
